Question,Answer
"The provided text offers little direct information to significantly refine the existing questions beyond what's already done in the initial response.  The added text focuses on actions individuals can take to support the SDGs, not on the specifics of land degradation, peace, and justice, which were already incorporated into the refined questions.  Therefore, the refined questions from the previous response remain the most appropriate and comprehensive.  There's no need to revert to original questions or make further changes based solely on this additional text.","Okay, I understand.  There is no need to revise the questions."
